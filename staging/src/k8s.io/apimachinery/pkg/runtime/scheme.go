package runtime

// Scheme defines methods for serializing and deserializing API objects, a type
// registry for converting group, version, and kind information to and from Go
// schemas, and mappings between Go schemas of different versions. A scheme is the
// foundation for a versioned API and versioned configuration over time.
//
// In a Scheme, a Type is a particular Go struct, a Version is a point-in-time
// identifier for a particular representation of that Type (typically backwards
// compatible), a Kind is the unique name for that Type within the Version, and a
// Group identifies a set of Versions, Kinds, and Types that evolve over time. An
// Unversioned Type is one that is not yet formally bound to a type and is promised
// to be backwards compatible (effectively a "v1" of a Type that does not expect
// to break in the future).
//
// Schemes are not expected to change at runtime and are only threadsafe after
// registration is complete.
